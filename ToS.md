# Participant Agreement


## Our Mission Statement:

The Participants [people, coworkers, groups and community] of the Space located at [address] cannot be pigeon holed by job titles or industry sectors. We have a wider curiosity. 

We are a gathering of people finding a way of working better together (both offline and on) focused on inspiration, participation and learning through doing. Anything can happen, the environments and space(s) change. 

* * *

Participants share a fundamental optimism, a spirit of liberty in action, encouragement and enlightenment. Where many people would see problems, Participants see opportunities for positive change, and they wish to take on the personal responsibility for making things happen. 

We work to inspiring anyone to help everyone. 
We use creative intelligence to solve real problems.

## Your Responsibilities [see Terms Of Use & Participation pages 2 to 5]

The Space is quite different to your average working environment. We're not a serviced office. In order to keep things ticking over nicely here are some essentials we ask everyone to be mindful of when using the space.

* Participation is an extreme sport. You break or lose it, you replace it.

* Equipment and Professional Liability is your own responsibility (our insurance cannot cover it).

* Cleaning up after yourself, emptying bins & recycling are everyone's responsibility. We work together to keep the Space we're proud of presentable.

* Do leave the spaces as you found them, or in better shape (decoration is welcomed).

* Anyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the Space or the Participants may be asked to leave.

* Be responsible and respectful with your internet usage. No bit-torrent or PrOn.

* Respect other peoples privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data.

* The last remaining keyholder must ask a non-keyholder to leave at the end of the night, and non-keyholders must respect
